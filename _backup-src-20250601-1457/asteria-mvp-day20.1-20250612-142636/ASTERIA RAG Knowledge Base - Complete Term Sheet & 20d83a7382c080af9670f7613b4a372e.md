**Goal**: Stop the bleeding - fix authentication and basic tool coordination

### 0.1 Fix RAG Authentication (Day 1-2)

**Impact**: Reduce 34% failure rate to <5%

```tsx
// In src/lib/rag/luxury-rag-service.ts
class LuxuryRAGService {
  private async initializeWithRetry(maxRetries = 3) {
    for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
      try {
        // Fix 1: Proper async initialization
        await this.waitForFirebaseAuth();

        // Fix 2: Add connection pooling
        this.db = admin.firestore();
        this.db.settings({
          ignoreUndefinedProperties: true,
          maxIdleChannels: 10
        });

        // Fix 3: Validate OpenAI before use
        if (!this.openai) {
          this.openai = new OpenAI({
            apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
          });
        }

        return true;
      } catch (error) {
        console.log(`RAG init attempt ${i + 1} failed, retrying...`);
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000 * i));
      }
    }
    throw new Error('RAG initialization failed after retries');
  }
}

```

### 0.2 Implement Tool Result Chaining (Day 3-4)

**Impact**: Improve tool coordination from 45% to 85%

```tsx
// New file: src/lib/agent/core/tool-chain.ts
export class ToolChain {
  private results: Map<string, any> = new Map();

  async executeChain(tools: ToolDefinition[], context: AgentContext) {
    for (const tool of tools) {
      // Pass previous results to next tool
      const enhancedParams = {
        ...tool.params,
        previousResults: this.results,
        chainContext: this.buildChainContext()
      };

      const result = await this.executeTool(tool, enhancedParams, context);
      this.results.set(tool.name, result);

      // Early exit on critical failure
      if (result.critical && !result.success) {
        return this.handleChainFailure(tool, result);
      }
    }

    return this.mergeResults();
  }
}

```

### 0.3 Add Fallback Mechanisms (Day 5)

**Impact**: Reduce generic responses from 49% to 20%

```tsx
// Enhancement to existing tool execution
async executeWithFallback(primaryTool: string, fallbackTool: string, params: any) {
  try {
    const primaryResult = await this.execute(primaryTool, params);

    if (primaryResult.totalFound === 0 || !primaryResult.success) {
      console.log(`Primary tool ${primaryTool} failed, using fallback ${fallbackTool}`);

      // Enhance query for fallback
      const enhancedParams = {
        ...params,
        query: this.enhanceQueryForWeb(params.query, params.intent),
        includeRealTime: true
      };

      return await this.execute(fallbackTool, enhancedParams);
    }

    return primaryResult;
  } catch (error) {
    return await this.execute(fallbackTool, params);
  }
}

```

### Phase 1: Core Journey Optimization (Week 2)

**Goal**: Fix intent classification and implement basic refinement

### 1.1 Fix Transportation Intent Classification

**Impact**: Improve from 65% to 90% accuracy

```tsx
// Update src/lib/agent/core/planner.ts
const bucketKeywords = {
  transportation: {
    // Add business context keywords
    primary: ['jet', 'flight', 'aviation', 'helicopter', 'yacht', 'car', 'vehicle'],
    context: ['business', 'meeting', 'conference', 'travel', 'transport', 'ride'],
    modifiers: ['private', 'luxury', 'premium', 'executive', 'first-class'],
    // New: Multi-word patterns
    patterns: [
      /premium\s+transportation/i,
      /business\s+(travel|trip|meeting)/i,
      /executive\s+(car|transport)/i
    ]
  }
};

```

### 1.2 Implement Basic Refinement Phase

**Impact**: Enable continuous improvement

```tsx
// New file: src/lib/agent/core/refiner.ts
export class ResponseRefiner {
  async refineResponse(
    response: AgentResponse,
    context: AgentContext,
    metrics: ResponseMetrics
  ): Promise<RefinedResponse> {
    // Step 1: Quality scoring
    const qualityScore = await this.scoreResponseQuality(response, context);

    // Step 2: Enhancement if needed
    if (qualityScore < 7.0) {
      response = await this.enhanceResponse(response, context);
    }

    // Step 3: Learning extraction
    const learnings = this.extractLearnings(response, context, metrics);
    await this.storeLearnings(learnings);

    // Step 4: Feedback preparation
    return {
      ...response,
      refinements: {
        qualityScore,
        enhancements: this.getEnhancements(),
        learnings: learnings,
        feedbackRequested: qualityScore < 8.0
      }
    };
  }
}

```

### Phase 2: Advanced Tool Orchestration (Week 3)

**Goal**: Implement composite tools and smart routing

### 2.1 Create Composite Tools

**Impact**: Reduce tool execution time by 40%

```tsx
// New file: src/lib/agent/tools/composite/luxury-aviation-search.ts
export const luxuryAviationSearch: CompositeTool = {
  name: 'luxury_aviation_complete',
  description: 'Complete aviation search with knowledge, availability, and pricing',
  combines: ['search_luxury_knowledge', 'amadeus_flight_search', 'fetch_active_services'],

  async execute(params: AviationParams, context: AgentContext) {
    // Parallel execution where possible
    const [knowledgeResults, availabilityResults] = await Promise.all([
      this.searchLuxuryKnowledge({
        query: `private aviation ${params.aircraft} ${params.route}`,
        serviceCategory: 'transportation',
        memberTier: context.memberTier
      }),
      this.checkAvailability(params)
    ]);

    // Smart merging of results
    return this.mergeAviationResults(knowledgeResults, availabilityResults, params.memberTier);
  }
};

```

### 2.2 Implement Workflow Triggers

**Impact**: Reduce escalation rate from 56% to 25%

```tsx
// Update src/lib/agent/integrations/workflow_bridge.ts
class EnhancedWorkflowBridge {
  private triggerRules = {
    // Value-based triggers
    highValue: (request) => {
      const estimatedValue = this.estimateRequestValue(request);
      return estimatedValue > 10000;
    },

    // Multi-service triggers
    multiService: (request) => {
      const services = this.detectServices(request);
      return services.length > 1;
    },

    // Tier-based triggers
    premiumTier: (context) => {
      return ['founding10', 'fifty-k'].includes(context.memberTier);
    },

    // Time-sensitive triggers
    urgent: (request) => {
      const urgencyScore = this.calculateUrgency(request);
      return urgencyScore > 0.7;
    }
  };

  shouldTriggerWorkflow(request: any, context: AgentContext): boolean {
    return Object.values(this.triggerRules).some(rule => rule(request));
  }
}

```

### Phase 3: Knowledge Base Enhancement (Week 4)

**Goal**: Populate comprehensive luxury knowledge

### 3.1 Structured Knowledge Population

```tsx
// Knowledge structure for each service category
const knowledgeTemplate = {
  aviation: {
    aircraft: {
      'Citation Latitude': {
        capacity: '6-9 passengers',
        range: '2,700 nm',

- Confidence scoring and validation

**Service Buckets**:

1. **Transportation**: Private aviation, luxury vehicles, yachts
2. **Events**: Exclusive access, VIP experiences, premieres
3. **Lifestyle**: Personal shopping, wellness, romance planning
4. **Brand Development**: Marketing, PR, thought leadership
5. **Investments**: Wealth management, portfolio optimization
6. **TAG Rewards**: Member benefits, exclusive networking

**Planning Prompt Template**:

```
Create a plan for this {intent} request:

Request: "{request}"
{memberInfo}
Extracted Entities: {entities}

Previous interactions: {context.iteration}

Create 3-7 steps that will fulfill this request. Consider:
- Member tier benefits and preferences
- Need for human verification on high-value requests
- Availability checking before confirmation
- Proper notification channels

```

### Phase 3: AGENT

**Definition**: Autonomous agent execution loop
**Components**:

- 4-phase processing cycle
- Tool selection and orchestration
- Workflow bridge activation

**Agent Loop Phases**:

1. **Plan**: Create actionable steps
2. **Execute**: Run tools and gather data
3. **Reflect**: Analyze results and learn
4. **Check**: Validate goal achievement

**Agent Context Structure**:

```tsx
{
  userId: string,
  sessionId: string,
  conversationHistory: Message[],
  memberProfile: {
    id: string,
    tier: 'founding10' | 'fifty-k' | 'corporate' | 'all-members',
    preferences: Record<string, any>,
    history: ServiceRequest[]
  },
  metadata: {
    requestTimestamp: Date,
    clientInfo: string
  }
}

```

### Phase 4: TOOLS

**Definition**: Service-specific tool execution
**Available Tools**:

### 1. search_knowledge_base (RAG Tool)

```tsx
{
  name: 'search_knowledge_base',
  description: 'Search the RAG knowledge base for service information',
  parameters: {
    query: string,
    intent?: string,
    memberTier?: string
  },
  priority: 'HIGHEST' // Always use before web search
}

```

### 2. fetch_active_services

```tsx
{
  name: 'fetch_active_services',
  description: 'Retrieve available luxury services',
  parameters: {
    category?: ServiceBucket,
    tier?: MemberTier
  }
}

```

  usage: 'Only when knowledge base lacks information'
}

```

### Phase 5: RESPONSE

**Definition**: Crafted response generation
**Components**:

- Luxury brand voice application
- Personalization based on member tier
- Anticipatory suggestions

**Response Principles** (The ASTERIA Doctrine):

1. **Anticipation over Reaction**: Suggest before being asked
2. **Curated Brevity**: Every word serves a purpose
3. **Invisible Excellence**: Complex operations appear simple
4. **Emotional Intelligence**: Read between the lines

**Response Templates**:

**For Aviation Requests**:

```
"I'd be delighted to arrange your private aviation experience to {destination}.
I've identified three exceptional aircraft options that align with your
preferences. Each offers something distinct - shall I present my recommendations?"

```

**For Dining Requests**:

```
"I have three extraordinary dining experiences in mind for {date} -
each offering something memorable. Based on your appreciation for
{preference}, I'm particularly excited about one option.
Shall I share the details?"

```

**For Lifestyle Services**:

```
"I'd be honored to curate this special {occasion} experience.
I'm already envisioning several approaches that would create
the perfect atmosphere. Let me gather a few details to ensure
every element exceeds expectations."

```

### Phase 6: REFINE

**Definition**: Continuous improvement and follow-through
**Components**:

- Booking confirmation detection
- Workflow triggering
- Human handoff when needed
- Follow-up scheduling

**Refinement Triggers**:

- Booking keywords: "let's book it", "confirm", "proceed", "go ahead"
- Escalation phrases: "speak to someone", "urgent", "immediately"
- Completion signals: "perfect", "that works", "confirmed"

**Workflow Integration**:

```tsx
if (bookingConfirmation.detected) {
  workflow.trigger({
    type: 'SERVICE_BOOKING',
    urgency: calculateUrgency(memberTier, serviceType),
    notification: {
      slack: true,
      format: 'SR-XXXXX',
      channel: '#concierge-requests'
    }
  });
}

```

## 3. Tool Usage Guidelines

### Tool Selection Matrix

| User Intent | Primary Tool | Secondary Tool | Workflow Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Service inquiry | search_knowledge_base | fetch_active_services | No |
| Specific booking | fetch_active_services | create_ticket | Yes - on confirmation |
| General question | search_knowledge_base | web_search (if needed) | No |
| Urgent request | create_ticket | notify_concierge | Yes - immediate |
| Price checking | search_knowledge_base | web_search (current rates) | No |
| Availability check | fetch_active_services | notify_concierge | Depends on tier |

### Tool Orchestration Rules

1. **Always Start with Knowledge Base**
    - Use `search_knowledge_base` before any other tool
    - Only use `web_search` if knowledge base returns no results
    - Prefer internal knowledge over external sources
2. **Service Discovery Flow**
    
    ```
    search_knowledge_base ‚Üí fetch_active_services ‚Üí create_ticket ‚Üí notify_concierge
    
    ```
    
3. **Urgency-Based Routing**
    - HIGH urgency + founding10 tier = Immediate concierge notification
    - MEDIUM urgency = Standard workflow with 2-hour SLA
    - LOW urgency = Batched processing with 24-hour SLA

---
