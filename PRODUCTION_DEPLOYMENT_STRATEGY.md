## 📊 **PRODUCTION MONITORING**

### **Key Metrics to Track**

#### **Health Monitoring**
```bash
# Set up monitoring alerts for:
# 1. Health endpoint status
curl https://innercircle.thriveachievegrow.com/api/health

# 2. Page load performance
# Monitor Core Web Vitals:
# - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) < 2.5s
# - FID (First Input Delay) < 100ms
# - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) < 0.1

# 3. Video intro performance
# - Frame loading success rate > 95%
# - Video start time < 3s
# - Skip rate (analytics)
```

#### **Error Monitoring**
```bash
# Monitor for:
# - 500 server errors
# - JavaScript console errors
# - Canvas/video loading failures
# - Dashboard transition issues
```

### **Analytics Integration** (Optional)
```javascript
// Add to VideoIntro.tsx for production insights:
useEffect(() => {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    // Track video intro performance
    const startTime = performance.now();
    
    return () => {
      const endTime = performance.now();
      const duration = endTime - startTime;
      
      // Send to your analytics service
      // gtag, mixpanel, etc.
    };
  }
}, []);
```
