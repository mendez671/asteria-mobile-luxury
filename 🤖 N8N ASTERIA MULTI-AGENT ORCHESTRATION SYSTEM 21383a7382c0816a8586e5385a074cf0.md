# 🤖 N8N ASTERIA MULTI-AGENT ORCHESTRATION SYSTEM

**Implementation Date**: December 14, 2024

**System Enhancement**: Building on 95% production-ready Asteria system

**Architecture**: Multi-agent orchestration with n8n coordination

---

## 🎯 **SYSTEM CLARIFICATION: 5 CORE AGENTS**

**Important Note**: This system consists of **5 specialized agents**, not 6 workflows. Each agent corresponds to one n8n workflow:

1. **Main Asteria Agent** → Main Orchestrator Workflow
2. **Authentication & Identity Agent** → Auth Agent Workflow  
3. **Member Data Agent** → Member Data Workflow
4. **Business Logic Agent** → Business Logic Workflow
5. **Integration Agent** → Integration Agent Workflow

*If you downloaded 6 workflows, one may be a duplicate or test version. The core production system uses these 5 specialized agents.*

## 🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### **Enhanced Multi-Agent Pattern**

```
Member Request → Main Asteria Agent (Enhanced Gatekeeper)
                      ↓
n8n Orchestration Layer → Specialized Agent Coordination
                      ↓
[Auth Agent] → [Member Data Agent] → [Business Logic Agent] → [Integration Agent]
      ↓                ↓                     ↓                        ↓
Firebase Auth → Member Context → Business Rules → External Services
      ↓                ↓                     ↓                        ↓
      └──────────────────┴─────────────────────┴────────────────────────┘
                                    ↓
                      Orchestrated Response → Member
